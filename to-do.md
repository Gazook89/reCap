### To Do:
- investigate better debounce method (`debounce-lead`)
- if expanding an effect into an occupied cell, create new row and move expanding effect into that row
- add effect tooltips on hover for more detailed info
- add color presets/datalist to color picker (mostly for Chrome)

### Longer Term:
- add ability to change row bg color
- add light theme
- improve accessibility: larger font mode, other stuff...
- export table as csv or turn-by-turn summary
- track bennies spent
- add directory of spells
- create user accounts
